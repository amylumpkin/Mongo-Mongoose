# Mongo-Mongoose
## Homework #18
Goal - This is a web app that lets users view and leave comments on the latest story/article being scraped from another site. Each scraped article is saved to the application database (Headline, Summary & URL). Users can then leave comments on the articles displayed and revisit them later and/or delete any comments they've made. The comments are saved to the database as well and associated with their articles. All stored comments are visible to every user.
